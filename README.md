# Secure-Banking-System

Used Django to create a banking system where a user can log in and transfer an amount to other accounts and keep track of previous transactions. 
The project was focused on creating a working system while learning about vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF and SQL injection and trying to exploit systems of other teams.
